// VID01 : Intro to OOP

main function call all
and handle communication

// Problems
Transformation
Reusability
Maintainability

// how oop solve them
//// transformation
///// objects instead of functions
// object is a set of attributes and functions
// they comm using their functions

// features of oop
bottom-up approach
programs organized around objects grouped in classes
focus on data with methods to operate upon object's data
interaction bet. objects using functions
reusability
// by encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction

// VID3: Inheritance

make a base class for common attributes and functions
then inherit and add the specific new attributes and functions
parent child relation
person -> student/employee -> driver/MathStudent -> ...

// VID4: Polymorphism

// functions with same name
//// but different parameters & body
// Abs(int) Abs(long) Abs(float)

// Function Signature
name
no. of parameters
type of parameters
order of them
->return of function is not a part of its signature
