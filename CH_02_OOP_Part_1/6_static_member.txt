// Static Members

// we can define class members statically using static keyword

// a static member is shared by all objects of the class

// whe we declare a member of a class as static
// it means no matter how many objects of the class are created
// there is only one copy of the static member

// Static Attributes
/// shared attributes among all objects from this class
/// its lifetime is the application lifetime
/// can be accessed from class name or any object (if public)
/// has a constant value
/// can be private or public
/// can be used in all class functions

// example: add StackNo in Stack class

// Static Functions
/// deal only with static attributes
/// this pointer is not sent to it
/// call by the class name (recommended) or any object
