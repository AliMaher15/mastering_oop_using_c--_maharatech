// Inheritance part 2

protected and private inheritance

// VID01: Inheritance types

Derived class name : <access specifier> base class name

// 1. Public
 all keep their accessability 

// 2. Protected
all inherited are now protected

// 3. Private
all inherited are now private

all new languages are public inheritance only

// VID02: Inheritance types Examples
// triangle, rectangle, square, circle


// VID03: multiple inheritance

// one class has 2 parents
// not recommended
/*
class Derived: public Base1, public Base2
{
    int c;
public:
    Derived (int x, int y, int z) : Base1(x), Base2(y)
    {
        c = z;
    }
    int product () {
        return a*b*c;
    }
};*/

// a problem when base1 and base2 have variables of same names
